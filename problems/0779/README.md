# [779. K-th Symbol in Grammar](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/)

We build a table of `n` rows (**1-indexed** ). We start by writing `0` in the 1<sup>st</sup> row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of `0` with `01`, and each occurrence of `1` with `10`.

- For example, for `n = 3`, the 1<sup>st</sup> row is `0`, the 2<sup>nd</sup> row is `01`, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> row is `0110`.

Given two integer `n` and `k`, return the k<sup>th</sup> (**1-indexed** ) symbol in the n<sup>th</sup> row of a table of `n` rows.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: row 1: 0
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

**Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n <= 30
- 1 <= k <= 2<sup>n</sup> - 1
